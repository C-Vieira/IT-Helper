# IT-Helper
A Simple Batch Script for Backing up Files and More.

   * Thank you for Checking out IT-Helper!

IT-Helper is a simple rickety batch script written to simplify and automate basic monotonous tasks such as loading and transfering user backup files.

It also contains some basic database integration for logging user device and support info into a postgres DB of your choice (you can swap out the defaults by editing the .bat file and changing the environment variables at the top!).

It's grown way too large for a batch script, for any possible additional features, a rewrite in some other language (like C++) would be a better pick, which may or may never happen.

Even though I myself wouldn't trust it to backup my files, it was a fun experiment that helped pass time...

   * Credits to Microsoft and Postgresql for the helpful utilities (SaRACmd and psql)!
